# Diagram Design

> **ppt-master integration note:** This skill is vendored as a *reference library*. In this repo, diagram
> slides are hand-authored by ppt-master's Executor as SVG pages in `svg_output/` — not emitted as
> standalone HTML. Do NOT run the URL onboarding flow (`references/onboarding.md`) or the upstream
> style-guide gate; colors, fonts, and icons always come from the project's `spec_lock.md`, and the SVG
> must obey ppt-master's technical constraints
> (`.claude/skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards.md`). The guidance below is upstream
> context — read it for per-type layout conventions, node/edge discipline, and complexity budgets,
> then author the page per ppt-master SKILL.md Step 6.
>
> The upstream onboarding / one-time-setup / standalone-HTML-export sections (§0 style-guide gate,
> §5 Design System skinning, §6 HTML-skin SVG primitives, §7 page layout, §8 summary cards,
> §10 templates & variants, §11 HTML output) are preserved **verbatim** in
> [`references/diagram-onboarding-legacy.md`](references/diagram-onboarding-legacy.md) —

Fourteen diagram types. One shared design system, complexity budget, and taste gate. Type-specific conventions live in `references/` and are loaded only when you pick a type.

## 1. Philosophy

**The highest-quality move is usually deletion.**

From `.impeccable.md`: *"Confident restraint. Earn every element. One color accent, two families, a small spacing vocabulary. If removing it wouldn't hurt the page, remove it."*

Applied to schematics:
- Every node represents a distinct idea. Two nodes that always travel together are one node.
- Every connection carries information. If the relationship is obvious from layout, remove the line.
- Coral is **editorial, not a flag.** 1–2 focal nodes per diagram. Using it on 5 nodes erases the signal.
- The schematic isn't done when everything is added. It's done when nothing can be removed.

**Target density: 4/10.** Enough to be technically complete. Not so dense it needs a guide. Above 9 nodes, it's probably two diagrams.

---

## 2. When to Use

Use for any of the 14 diagram types (§3) when a reader will learn more from a visual than from prose, a table, or a bulleted list.

**Don't use for:**
- Quick unicode diagrams → use **wiretext**.
- Lists of things → table or bullets.
- Simple before/after → table.
- One-shape "diagrams" → just write the sentence.

Before drawing, ask: *Would the reader learn more from this than from a well-written paragraph?* If no, don't draw.

## 3. Diagram Types

### Selection guide

| If you're showing… | Use | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Components + connections in a system | **Architecture** | [type-architecture.md](references/type-architecture.md) |
| Decision logic with branches | **Flowchart** | [type-flowchart.md](references/type-flowchart.md) |
| Time-ordered messages between actors | **Sequence** | [type-sequence.md](references/type-sequence.md) |
| States + transitions + guards | **State machine** | [type-state.md](references/type-state.md) |
| Entities + fields + relationships | **ER / data model** | [type-er.md](references/type-er.md) |
| Events positioned in time | **Timeline** | [type-timeline.md](references/type-timeline.md) |
| Cross-functional process with handoffs | **Swimlane** | [type-swimlane.md](references/type-swimlane.md) |
| Two-axis positioning / prioritization | **Quadrant** | [type-quadrant.md](references/type-quadrant.md) |
| Hierarchy through containment / scope | **Nested** | [type-nested.md](references/type-nested.md) |
| Parent → children relationships | **Tree** | [type-tree.md](references/type-tree.md) |
| Human/agent/team ownership, reporting, routing, escalation | **Org chart** | [type-org-chart.md](references/type-org-chart.md) |
| Stacked abstraction levels | **Layer stack** | [type-layers.md](references/type-layers.md) |
| Overlap between sets | **Venn** | [type-venn.md](references/type-venn.md) |
| Ranked hierarchy or conversion drop-off | **Pyramid / funnel** | [type-pyramid.md](references/type-pyramid.md) |

Rules of thumb:
- If a 3-column table communicates the same thing, pick the table.
- If you're combining two types, pick the dominant axis — don't hybridize grammars.
- If you're past the complexity budget (§7), split into an overview + detail.

**Always load the relevant `references/type-*.md` before drawing** — it contains layout conventions, anti-patterns, and example files for that type.

## 4. Universal Anti-patterns

These mark "AI slop" schematics of any type:

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Dark mode + cyan/purple glow | Looks "technical" without design decisions |
| JetBrains Mono as blanket "dev" font | Mono is for *technical* content — ports, commands, URLs. Names go in Geist sans. |
| Identical boxes for every node | Erases hierarchy |
| Legend floating inside the diagram area | Collides with nodes |
| Arrow labels with no masking rect | Bleeds through the line |
| Vertical `writing-mode` text on arrows | Unreadable |
| 3 equal-width summary cards as default | Generic grid — vary widths |
| Shadow on any element | Shadows are out. Borders are in. |
| `rounded-2xl` on boxes | Max radius 6–10px or none |
| Coral on every "important" node | Coral is 1–2 editorial accents, not a signaling system |

Type-specific anti-patterns live in each `references/type-*.md`.

## 7. Layout & Spacing

### 4px grid

**All values — font sizes, padding, node dimensions, gaps, x/y coords — divisible by 4.** Non-negotiable.

| Category | Allowed values |
|---|---|
| Font sizes | 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 40 |
| Node width / height | 80, 96, 112, 120, 128, 140, 144, 160, 180, 200, 240, 320 |
| x / y coordinates | multiples of 4 |
| Gap between nodes | 20, 24, 32, 40, 48 |
| Padding inside boxes | 8, 12, 16 |
| Border radius | 4, 6, 8 |

Exempt: stroke widths (0.8, 1, 1.2), opacity values, and the 22×22 dot-pattern.

Quick check: if a coordinate ends in 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 — fix it.

### Complexity budget (per diagram)

| Limit | Rule |
|---|---|
| Max nodes | 9 |
| Max arrows / transitions | 12 |
| Max coral elements | 2 |
| Max lifelines (sequence) | 5 |
| Max lanes (swimlane) | 5 |
| Max items (quadrant) | 12 |
| Max entities (ER) | 8 |
| Max nesting levels (nested) | 6 |
| Max tree depth | 4 |
| Max org chart depth | 4 |
| Max org chart nodes | 12 |
| Max layers (layer stack) | 6 |
| Max circles (venn) | 3 |
| Max layers (pyramid) | 6 |
| Max annotation callouts | 2 |

If you exceed, split into two diagrams (overview + detail).

## 9. Pre-Output Checklist (Taste Gate)

Run before producing any diagram.

**Type fit:**
- [ ] Right type for what I'm showing? (§3 selection guide)
- [ ] Would a table / paragraph do the same job? (If yes — don't draw.)
- [ ] Loaded the matching `references/type-*.md`?

**Remove test:**
- [ ] Can I remove any node? (Would a reader still understand?)
- [ ] Can I merge any two nodes? (Do they always travel together?)
- [ ] Can I remove any arrow? (Is the relationship obvious from layout?)
- [ ] Can I remove any label? (Does color or shape already signal it?)

**Signal:**
- [ ] Coral used on ≤2 elements? If more, which actually deserve focal status?
- [ ] Legend covers every type used — and nothing extra?
- [ ] Within the type's complexity budget (§7)?

**Technical:**
- [ ] Arrows drawn before boxes?
- [ ] Every arrow label has an opaque `fill="#f5f5f5"` rect behind it?
- [ ] Legend is a horizontal bottom strip, not floating?
- [ ] No vertical `writing-mode` text?
- [ ] `viewBox` expanded for the legend strip (~60px)?
- [ ] Every font size, coord, width, height, gap divisible by 4?

**Typography:**
- [ ] Human-readable names in Geist sans, not Geist Mono?
- [ ] Technical sublabels (ports, commands, URLs) in Geist Mono?
- [ ] Page title in Instrument Serif?
- [ ] Annotation callouts (if any) in *italic* Instrument Serif? (see [primitive-annotation.md](references/primitive-annotation.md))
- [ ] No JetBrains Mono anywhere?
