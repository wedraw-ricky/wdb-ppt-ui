# Speaker Notes Generation Framework

**Trigger**: `design_spec.md §X` records a speaker-notes request, or the user asks for notes / narration later (e.g. via [`generate-audio`](../workflows/generate-audio.md)). Default `None requested` → skip this entire section.

## 1. Generate Complete Speaker Notes Document

After all SVG pages are finalized, enter Logic Construction Phase and write the full notes to `notes/total.md`. Batch-writing (not per-page) lets transitions plan coherently.

**Pure spoken narration**: notes are read aloud verbatim by `notes_to_audio.py` (TTS). Write only what should be spoken. No visible markers, no labeled meta-lines, no enumerated key-point lists, no duration annotations — anything you write outside the heading will be vocalized.

**Per-page structure**: `# <number>_<page_title>` heading (the `#` heading line is the only thing stripped before TTS), pages separated by `---`. Body is 2–5 natural sentences carrying the page's core message. Page-to-page transitions live inside the opening sentence as natural prose ("接下来……" / "Having framed X, let's turn to Y") — no bracketed `[过渡]` / `[Transition]` tags.

**Concrete examples** — same shape applies to any language; just write naturally in that language.

# 02_市场格局

在明确了行业背景之后，我们来看具体的市场格局。当前线上零售集中度持续上升，前三大平台合计份额已经达到百分之六十八，腰部玩家正在被快速挤压，留给新进入者的窗口期不超过十八个月。这意味着我们的策略必须聚焦，而不是铺开。

# 02_market_landscape

Having framed the industry backdrop, let's look at the actual market landscape. Online retail concentration keeps rising — the top three platforms now hold sixty-eight percent of combined share, mid-tier players are being squeezed fast, and the window for new entrants is under eighteen months. This means our strategy has to focus, not spread.

**Number readability**: TTS reads digits and symbols literally. Prefer fully-spelled forms in the language being spoken when literal pronunciation would be awkward (e.g. Chinese "百分之六十八" reads better than "68%"; "1-2分钟" reads as "一减二分钟"). Plain integers and percentages in English are fine as-is.

**Common mistakes to avoid**:
- Leaving any bracketed stage marker (`[过渡]` / `[Transition]` / `[Pause]` / `[Data]` / `[Scan Room]` / `[Interactive]` / `[Benchmark]` etc.) in the text — they will be read aloud literally.
- Adding `要点：① …` / `Key points: (1) …` / `时长：2分钟` / `Duration: 2 minutes` / `Flex: …` lines — TTS will speak "要点 一 …".
- Mixing languages within one deck's notes.

## 2. Split Into Per-Page Note Files

Auto-split `notes/total.md` into per-page files in `notes/`.

**Naming**: match SVG names (`01_cover.svg` → `notes/01_cover.md`); `slide01.md` also supported (legacy).
